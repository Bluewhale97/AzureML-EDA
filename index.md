## Introduction

EDA, Exploratory Data Analysis serves to analyze and investigate data sets for their main characteristics, the convential process to explore data includes basic descriptive analysis, missing values analysis & imputation, outliers identity and removal, clustering, association findings, data skewness(labeling) and time-based clustering and analytics. 

In this article, with the analysis using Python with NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib, we will represent the EDA in an Azure Machine Learning compute instance which should be connected to the Python 3.6 - AzureML kernel. Actually there are a wide range of tools and languages that we can use to perform it, we will use Jupyter notebooks and Python in Azure.
